Introduction
============

Purplenet is a web user interface for OpenVPN tunnelling servers aimed
to make it easier to control, manage, deploy OpenVPN based
connectivity services to the end users and devices. This kind of
connectivity services can be utilised for example for providing secure
VPN connectivity as well as in general providing better access and
connectivity to the network services offered by the service provider.

Current features include:

	* Management of the PKI
		* creating the CA hierarchy
		* granting certificates
		* revoking your own certificates
		* administrator access to revoking others' certificates
	
	* Config generation for client and server
		* Customizable through Django templates
	
	* Shibboleth integration
		* Login via Shibboleth
		* Mapping of Shibboleth properties (envvars) into groups

For missing and incomplete functionality, see the file TODO.

Concepts
========

ORGANIZATIONS - Several organizations may be configured in the system, each of
which has access to one or more networks.

CLIENTS, ADMINISTRATORS AND SUPERUSERS - Three levels of access are available
in this release of PurpleNet:

	* Clients are normal users that may request certificates and revoke their
	  own existing certificates.
	
	* Administrators have management access to one or more organizations. They
	  can revoke certificates of users in their organizations and (in
	  standalone mode) manage their membership.
	
	* Superusers can change and configure just about anything in the system.

ORGANIZATIONAL MAPPING - The system can be configured to use Shibboleth as its
authentication backend. 

Installation
============

1. Put the purplenet and libpurplenet packages in your PYTHON_PATH.

2. Create a database in an RDBMS supported by Django (PostgreSQL recommended).

3. Copy purplenet/settings.py.dist to purplenet/settings.py and edit it to
   match your installation.

4. Source "env.sh" and run "manage syncdb".

5. Configure the web server (see configuration examples below)

6. Prepare a directory that is writable by your web server. This directory will
   contain the Certificate Authorities of your installation.

7. Point your browser to http://path/to/purplenet/setup and fill in the
   setup form.

8. Log in as a superuser and create at least one organization, network and
   server.
   
9. Download the OpenVPN server configuration from your PurpleNet portal and
   use it to deploy the OpenVPN server.

Configuration example
=====================

This configuration example is for Apache 2.2, Django 1.0.2 and mod_python.
Paths will need to be adjusted for your installation.

/etc/apache2/sites-available/default:

    <Location /purplenet>
            SetHandler python-program
            PythonHandler django.core.handlers.modpython
            SetEnv DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE purplenet.settings
            PythonOption django.root /purplenet
            PythonDebug On
            PythonAutoReload On
            PythonPath "['/path/to/purplenet'] + sys.path"
            PythonInterpreter purplenet
    </Location>

    Alias "/public_demo/media/admin" "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/Django-1.0.2_final-py2.5.egg/django/contrib/admin/media"
    Alias "/public_demo/media" "/path/to/purplenet/media"

    <Location /purplenet/media>
            SetHandler None
    </Location>
