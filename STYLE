Coding Conventions for OpenVPNweb
=================================

vim: shiftwidth=4 expandtab
encoding: utf-8

Author: Santtu Pajukanta <santtu.pajukanta@tut.fi>

Introduction
============

This document outlines the programming style for OpenVPNweb.

Examples in this document are indented by four spaces. This indentation is
not part of the actual code of the example.

Python code
===========

The recommendations given in [PEP-8] should be followed where appropriate.

The Python source code of OpenVPNweb is indented at four spaces per level.

Each executable Python source file should start with the following header:

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    # encoding: utf-8
    # vim: shiftwidth=4 expandtab

Each nonexecutable Python source file should start with the following header:

    # encoding: utf-8
    # vim: shiftwidth=4 expandtab

In both executable and nonexecutable cases, this header should be followed by
the license boilerplate.

Django templates
================

Templates are written with the readability of the template in mind, not the
readability of the content produced by the template. An automatic filter to
beautify or compress the content produced by the template may be added later.

Each template should begin with the following header:

    {% extends "whatever/this/template/extends.html" %}
    {% comment %}
    encoding: utf-8
    vim: shiftwidth=2 expandtab
    {% endcomment%}

Templates are indented at two spaces per level. Each XHTML tag and template
tag that has a closiong tag increases the indentation level, with the notable
exception of {% block %} and {% comment %} that are not indented further.

Example:

    {# CORRECT #}
    {% block content %}
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <ul>
      {% for flurb in flurbs %}
        <li>{{ flurb }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endblock %}

    {# INCORRECT #}
    {% block content %}
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>    {# Wrong: block should not be indented #}
      <ul>
      {% for flurb in flurbs %} {# Wrong: this is inside <ul> #}
        <li>{{ flurb }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
      </ul>
    {% endblock %}

Django models
=============

    TBD.
