Release-critical
================

Process
-------

- Get some project hosting, a mailing list and a bug tracker.

- Get approval for release from the steering group

Documentation
-------------

- Example httpd configuration

- A template for the Finnish privacy policy ("Rekisteriseloste")

Bugs
----

- Some exceptions still get through, eg. unique constraint violations. Hunt
  them down and kill them with fire.

New features
------------

Further improvement
===================

Security
--------

- At the moment the CA needs to reside in the same file system with the web
  server running the portal. To be able to grant certificates the portal needs
  read access to certain CA files, such as the CA certificate and private key,
  and read/write access to others, such as the CA database and CRL. As the web
  server is probably the most likely attack vector, it should be made possible
  to separate the CA from the web server using some form of RPC.
  
  A generic RESTful CA interface might also be useful on its own.

Incomplete functionality
------------------------

- Even though multiple server support is planned and built into the database
  schema, certain assumptions are currently being made that will not hold in a
  true multi-server setup. First of all, the learn-address.py script needs a
  database connection to the database of the portal to determine the network
  to which an incoming VPN connection should be dropped. Secondly, the OpenVPN
  server requires a copy of the CRL that, unless the OpenVPN server and PKI
  reside in the same file system, needs to be periodically refreshed using
  cron or other means.
  
New functionality
-----------------

- An "Advanced order form" where you can eg. specify the CN of the certificate
  and/or get an existing CSR signed.
